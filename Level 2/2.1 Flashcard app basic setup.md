First we will make an index file to place our app in. Call this file index.html and let's start with the code that vs code autofills when you type !.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

Now lets change the document title to ```Flashcards```. We will also add a nav bar into the body of the page:
```
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Flashcards</h1>
        <nav>
            <button data-view="create">Create</button>
            <button data-view="list">List</button>
            <button data-view="study">Study</button>
        </nav>
    </header>
</body>
```
Now if we go into the file explorer and open our file it should look something like this:
![nav bar without styling](./images/Nav%20bar%20no%20css.png)
As you can see this isn't what a navigation bar (nav bar) normally looks like. Let's add some styles...

First, we will add a stylesheet. You should remember how to add this file and link it to our html file but I will walk you through it nonetheless. First make a new file called ```style.css``` by clicking the button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus sign. Then go to the ```index.html``` file and add the following as the last line of the head tag:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

So the top of you file should look like:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Flashcards</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```
Now let's look at our ```styles.css``` file. It should just be blank. We can start by adding a flex box to our nav bar this will tell the computer that we want to fit ever
ything on one line (make our nav bar a bar instead of whatever it is now [a page I guess]). 

```
header {
    display: flex;
}
```

Now let's open this again and see what it looks like or, if you still have it open hit the refresh button:

![refresh button](./images/Refresh_button.png)

Okay now that we have it refreshed it should look something like this:

![nav bar with flexbox](./images/Nav_bar_flex.png)

That's more like it but normally in nav bars the title is on one side and the buttons on the other. We can use justify content to change how this looks:
```
header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
}
```
So now we have:
![space around](./images/nav_bar_space_around.png)

Let's try some other looks for our nav bar. Instead of ```space-around``` lets do ```end``` (note this has the same effect as ```right```):
![end](./images/nav_bar_end.png)

Now let's try ```baseline``` (note this has the same effect as ```left```):

![baseline](./images/Nav_bar_baseline.png)

Finally let's try one more option ```space-between```:

![space-between](./images/Nav_bar_space-between.png)

Now you'll notice this is more like a standard nav bar but with one issue everything is shoved against the sides. Let's fix this with some padding. You probably remember how we used padding with our single flashcard in level 1. Now we will use padding on our nav bar. Let's put 0 on the top and bottom and 1 rem on the sides. 1 rem tells us to use the width of the font size of the root element which in this case would be our body tag. If we used 2 rem it would be twice the font size of our body tag.

```
header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 0 1rem;
}
```

Now we have this:
![nav bar with padding](./images/nav_bar_padding.png)

Now notice how the buttons are higher up than the heading that says Flashcards. Let's center the buttons vertically:

```
header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 0 1rem;
    align-items: center;
}
```

Much better. Finally let's make this header ```CornflowerBlue```

```
header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 0 1rem;
    align-items: center;
}
```
