Python is a coding language that is used for backend programming and data science applications. It can be run as the shell or as an executable file. We discussed bash executable files in ```The_LS_Command.md```. Simarily python files can be executed (or ran) by the computer. First let's discuss running python in the shell, but before we do that let's make sure python is installed: ```$python3 --version```. Then once you press enter the next line should say: ```Python 3.9.6``` (or some other number)

From the terminal we can start the python shell by typing ```$ python3```. Then it should tell you a some information and give you the prompt ```>>>```. This prompt is just like the ```$``` and we can type python commands (aka code) into the computer and it will give us a response. Let's try typeing ```>>> print("Hello World")``` (and hit enter of course). And Wa La it prints out Hello World.
