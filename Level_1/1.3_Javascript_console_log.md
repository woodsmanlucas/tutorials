Before starting this tutorial do the tutorial Html & Css Intro. Javascript controls the functionality of the page and allows us to make a webpage interactive. Let's start with our first print statement in the console. Add a script tag to the body element of the page and within the script tag add ```console.log("Hello World")```:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
...
</head>
<body>
...
<script>
console.log("Hello World")
</script>
</body>
```

Now let's open the page again ```$ open my_first_page.html```. Now right click anywhere on the page and click on inspect. Then click on the console at the top left of the page and there you will see your console log. Console logs are a good way to check if a certain portion of code is being activated.
Next we can make a button
